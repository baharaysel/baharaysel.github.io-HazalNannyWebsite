              knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mrs Asik has graduated from the department of Philosophy at
              Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey in 2015. During her
              bachelor’s degree studies, she improved her knowledge and skills
              on many areas and forged for a unique set of qualifications
              throughout the years. She took very efficient steps and attended
              many training programs during her studies to develop a successful
              career in the field of education of young people and children in
              need.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between 09.2014 and 06.2015, she took Pedagogical Training Program
              at her own university, Anadolu University and gained the
              Paediatric Certificate. She then successfully completed
              occupational trainings on Teaching Practice, Special Teaching
              Methods, Instructional Technology and Material Design, Educational
              Psychology, and Educational Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Spring of 2017, she began teaching as a philosophy teacher
              at Sinav Education College at Ankara, Turkey, where she attended
              Counsellor Workshop and completed her training which granted her
              the title of counsellor teacher as well. While working there for
              one academic year, she also attended another workshop and
              completed her Guidance Certificate Program in 2018. Later on, she
              completed Participation in Education Program at Istanbul Gelisim
              University at Ankara, Turkey, whereby she got training on the
              topic of Communication Disorder with Children and Teenagers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having been interested in care for students and children with
              special needs, she decided to improve her knowledge on this field
              further and enrolled in Turkish Sign Language Training course in
              Ankara in 2019. Beginning with the Summer Term of 2019, she
              started to work at Toprak Private Education Course in Ankara,
              Turkey and since then, she has been teaching as a counsellor and
              philosophy teacher there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her experience as a counsellor teacher has so far turned out to be
              what she has desired to have for her career. During the time
              being, she has had the chance to take care and deal with so many
              young students and children in need and spared a substantial
              amount of time for them with a unique sense of self-devotion.
              Dedicated to breathing the same environment with children and 3
              young students all the time, she has found the happiness and
              tranquillity in being with them and making them happy. She pretty
              much enjoyed spending her time with them and has always been the
              favourite teacher of theirs as a sincere and cordial counsellor
              educator.
            </p>
            <p>
              She invested a considerable portion of her time to specialize on
              the students and young children with special needs and mastered
              her skills accordingly via different training programs and
              workshops. While developing a career in the education sector as a
              philosophy teacher, she also chose a path to become a counsellor
              teacher where she managed to take care of children and young
              students more closely and deal with their problems and issues in a
              more convenient and instructive way. Besides, she gave private
              tutoring lessons to a lot of students and children with special
              needs such as children with dyslexia and autism and other
              disabilities. She contributed to the well-being and the learning
              processes of the children effectively and she became a high in
              demand teacher in the eyes of many families in need those kinds of

                  Marbles are as popular now as they ever were! Why not upcycle
                  some of your old cardboard and create a fun marble puzzle for
                  the little ones. Cardboard Labrinth Game is great fun for
                  slightly older kids. You can adjust your maze to suit the age
                  of the child too. Small children might want to roll the
                  marbles around using loo rolls. Remember always to supervise
                  when playing with marbles.

                  Simply grab some coloured paper, scissors and PVA glue. You
                  could also use old magazines and cut them up into lots of
                  different pieces (the kids can help with that bit too), then
                  use them to build up mosaic art!
